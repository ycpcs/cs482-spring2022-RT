# Expectations for Weekly Journals, Status Reports, and Demos

On the weeks that you do not have a Milestone to present, each team will give a status report.  Here is what we expect to have from you for those weekly (Wednesday) meetings.  


## Journal entries (individual)

Each team member should have at least one issue in the team's issue tracker.  Each week, each team member should add at least one comment to this issue to document his or her work for the week.  These comments should be comprehensive - do **NOT** simply write a couple of lines - provide enough detail so that other team members and your instructors and advisors can comprehend what you've accomplished.  Each weekly entry should contain a list of the following:

* Links to issues that were created/opened by you 
* Links to issues that were closed by you
* Links to each commit made by you

Please format your entry as a *bulleted list*.

You can create a link to a commit by pasting the first 8 (or so) hex digits of its hash code.

You will also each maintain a Weekly Journal as a shared Google doc on your team's drive.  Your journal entries should summarize your work for the preceding week.  You entires will be graded on an Exceeds, Meets, Below Expectations basis.  Each weekly journal entry is due every Wednesday by Noon (before the start of class) and **MUST** address the following points:
* What your TEAM accomplished in the past week
* What YOU accomplished in the past week
* What challenges you faced that impeded your progress, and how you dealt with them
* What you intend to accomplish for the next week
* Make sure to include links to your major commits for the week


## Team Presentation and Demo (team and individual)

During the weekly staus reports, each team will present their progress.  The team's job is to present/demonstrate what the team worked on during the previous week, and how the team's efforts are contributing to the overall success of the project.  The team should present two or three of your most important contributions (as documented in your journal entries for the previous week).

Ways that you can demonstrate progress include

* **Requirements, analysis, and design artifacts**: During the early stages of the project, documenting requirements, modeling the problem domain, and developing a system design to meet the requirements are very important in order to create a solid foundation for your system.  In addition, as you iterate later in the semester, it is useful to update parts of the requirements and analysis/design models in order to support further progress towards meeting the system requirements.
* **Working, tested, integrated code**: Assuming that your team has a solid design, this is generally the most important type of contribution.
* **Prototype code**: A stand-alone proof-of-concept demo is fine, especially in the early stages of the project.  However, all such work needs to be integrated into the main code base in a timely manner.
* **Equipment/apparatus**: If your project has external equipment or apparatus, then you can show us progress on its construction and setup.  However, time spent on equipment/apparatus should be the mininum necessary to support the needs of the software you are creating.

# Evaluation

For each weekly meeting, you (individually) will receive one of the following evaluations:

* **Exceeds expectations**: We think you are making an extraordinary contribution to your project, and that overall, your team is on course to have a very strong final progress.
* **Meets expectations**: We think you are making an adequate contribution to your project, and that your team is on track for a solid (but perhaps not exceptional) final product.
* **Below expectations**: We are concerned that you are not making a sufficient contribution to your team's project, and that your team's final product will not meet the minimum expectations.
