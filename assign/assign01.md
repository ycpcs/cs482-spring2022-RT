# Your Task

In this assignment you will propose the project you or your group will work on for the semester.  You will also set up a repository and issue tracker, and document the requirements you plan to address for [Milestone 1](assign03.html).  You will also need to have the Radio Telescope up and running, and have all of the development tools installed and ready to use for all team members.

# Deliverables

There are four deliverables.

## Proposal description

Using Google Docs, write a 4-5 page proposal describing your project.  Describe what problem it is intended to solve, who the users are, what languages/frameworks/technologies you plan to use, etc.  Use diagrams as appropriate (e.g., user interface sketches, block diagrams, DB schemas, UML, etc.)

<div class="callout">
<b>Important</b>: It is **imperative that you consult with your YCAS clients** to discuss tasks and priorities before you write the proposal.  It is also **imperative that you consult and cooridinate with the Radio Telescope Engineering Capstone** and that you read the documentation and review the GitHub repository from the Fall 2021 CS481 Radio Telescope team.
</div>

## Repository and issue tracker

Update your project repository (e.g., on [Github](https://github.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)) and your issue tracker.  In your proposal document, include a link to the repository.

## Readiness Demo
You must demonstrate that all team members have the development environments and tools installed and configured for development of their assignments,  You nust also be able to replicate the demo from the Final Presentation of the Fall 2021 CS481 team.  Make sure that everyone on the team knows how to run the telescope, and is familiar with the tools that are already in place.

## Requirements for Milestone 1

Update your issue tracker to document the requirements that you plan to address in [Milestone 1](assign03.html).  Each requirement should be a single issue, written in the form of a user story or use case, with a reasonable amount of detail.  In your issue tracker, create a milestone for Milestone 1 and associate your issues with it.  (Both Github's and Bitbucket's issue trackers support milestones.)
