title: "Assignment 5: Engineering and Computer Science Expo"
---

Due: [See the Assignments page for due dates](../assign/index.html)

# Your task
Present your progress so far at the Engineering and Computer Science Expo in coordination with the Engineering Capstone Team.


# Deliverables
You will be conducting this presentation in conjunction with the Radio Telescope Engineering Capstone presentation and demo.  As such, you must integrate and coordinate your presentation and demo with the Engineeering team.

You must develop **team posters**, **presentations**, and **demos** to be presented at the annual **Engineering and Computer Science Expo**, which will be held in Kinsley Engineering Center.  **I strongly suggest that you make arrangements with your other professors ahead of time to be excused from any classes you might have that afternoon - as you will need the time for final preparations and then presentations at the E&CS Expo**.  The posters are due (printed and mounted on poster board) in class the Wednesday before the Expo.  That class session will be used to review your progress, and go over your presentations and demos for the E&CS Expo later that week.

The only other specific deliverables for this assignment are the demonstration (including UML model, DB schema, and block diagrams of inter-related parts), documentation of individual progress, and documentation of requirements to be addressed in the final milestone.
