title: "Assignment 3: Milestone 1"

Due: [See the Assignments page for due dates](../assign/index.html)

# Your task

Your first task is to demonstrate your progress on your Milestone 1 requirements.  You or your group should be prepared to

* Demonstrate a working implementation of features addressing the Milestone 1 requirements
* Be prepared to discuss the design, implementation, and testing of these features

To facilitate discussion of your design, you should be prepared to present a UML model of important aspects of your problem domain and system.

In addition, you should document your individual contributions to the project.  If you are working on an individual project, you don't need to do anything special, since your commit history will be sufficient.  If you are working on a team project, your commit history can be sufficient if most of your contributions are associated with your user identity.  If some substantial fraction of your contributions are *not* associated with your user identity (for example, because you participated in pair programming, and most of your contributions were commited by a teammate), then you should keep a detailed log of your contributions and the associated code commits.

Your second task is to document requirements to be addressed in [Milestone 2](assign04.html).  You should create a new milestone (i.e., for Milestone 2) in your issue tracker, document requirements as issues in the form of use cases or user stories, and associate the issues with Milestone 2.

# Deliverables
You will be working on all milestones in coordination with the Radio Telescope Engineering Capstone team.  As such, it is possible that you will need to provide support for the Engineering team's presentation, and they might need to provide support to your presentation and demo.  Due to scheduling and time constraint issues, the CS Senior Design, and Engineering Capstone ECE presentations and demos will generally be given at the same time, thus you must also coordinate your deliverables with the Engineering team.

There are no specific deliverables for this assignment other than the demonstration (including UML model, DB schema, and block diagrams of inter-related parts), documentation of individual progress, and documentation of requirements to be addressed in the next milestone.
