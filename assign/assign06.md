# Deliverables

* Your main task is to demonstrate the final version of your project.  The demonstration should focus on the features addressing the requirements for Milestone 4, but should also incorporate important features from previous milestones in order to give an overall assessment of what your system is capable of.  This presentation will showcase the **final working, Radio Telescope software system, fully integrated with the Radio Telescope control electronics and hardware** for an audience to include YCAS members, the director of York County Parks, faculty members, family and friends of the Radio Telescope team members, students, alumni, and industry partners.  It will be the culminating experience of your college career.

* This milestone presentation will take place in various venues, including the Project Workspace in order to demonstrate the actual Radio Telescope hardware and control electronics full assembled on the test stand in the Project Workspace, and will also be presented live on-line via Zoom.

* You will also need to complete the [Final Self/Peer Evaluation](PeerEval-RadioTelescope-Sp21-final.pdf) form.  [Download the MS Word version](PeerEval-RadioTelescope-Sp22-final.doc), fill it out, and submit in **PDF format via email to your instructors by the due date.**

* Each team is also responsible for writing a comprehensive technical report similar in scope to the final  technical reports that you provided for CS 481 in the Fall.  Here are the [technical report guidelines](finalreport.html) for each team's final technical report.  This is a team assignment (there should only be one report per sub-team), but everyone on that sub-team is expected to make a significant contribution to their team's technical report.

* Use a shared Google Doc to write the technical report and store it on your Google Drive.  The **rough draft** should be a 95% complete version of the Final Technical Report.  It should be structurally complete, with figures (and figure #'s and captions), the vast majority of the structure and content, references, and thoroughly proofread by all sub-team members.  Submit the rough draft as a shared Google Doc in your Team Drive by the due date.  Your instructors will review and comment in your Google Doc before your final presentation.

* For your **final technical report**, you will add any missing structure, figures, content, and references, as well as address all of the comments, and conduct a final proofread.  **The Final Technical Report should be stored as a PDF in your Google Team Drive, and submitted to your instructors via PDF by the due date.**

* Each team is also responsible for creating a Team Poster in **Powerpoint** to summarize your accomplishments.  We will use those posters for future Open Houses, and other YCP and YCAS Events.  The posters will be sumarize your final accomplishments, progress, and the state of your portion of the project.  **Create your poster in Powerpoint, store it on your Google Drive, and submit the final poster in PDF format via email to your instructors by the due date.**
