NOTE: You MUST maintain your weekly journals throughout the ENTIRE semester, even on the weeks in which there are Milestone presentations.  I expect that the CS and ECE teams will be conducting joint status reports on WEDNESDAYs, and the Engineering Capstone ME team will be giving their status reports on FRIDAYs.  You are expected to attend both meeting times, ans there is a lot of coordination that will need to conducted across all of the teams.
