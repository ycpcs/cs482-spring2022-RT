During the weekly stand-up meetings, you will present a summary of your accomplishments and progress, challenges, and goals for the coming week, as well as demos of the current functionality of the your responsibilities, as well as the overall system.  NOTE: You MUST maintain your weekly journals throughout the ENTIRE semester, even on the weeks in which there are Milestone presentations.  I expect that the CS and ECE teams will be conducting joint status reports on WEDNESDAYs, and the Engineering Capstone ME team will be giving their status reports on FRIDAYs.  You are expected to attend both meeting times, ans there is a lot of coordination that will need to conducted across all of the teams.

* **Jan 28** &mdash; Our first meeting of the semester will be on Friday, 1-28-22 from Noon to 1:15p in KEC 118 and/or the Project Workspace.  We will be going over administrative and orgainzational stuff, and then getting into the nitty gritty of how to approach the seemster, and spin up the new team members, as well as how to integrate with the RT Engineering Capstone team.

* **Jan 28** &mdash; Welcome back!  The [Syllabus](syllabus.html) and [Assignments](assign/index.html) pages have a complete overview of the course and what you will be expected to do.
